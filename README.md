### Frontend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/lucylee-412/todo-app-react).

PSQL was used to create the database. The configuration can be found [here](db.js).  

Make sure you have the latest version of Express and Node installed.  

`npm install`  
After connecting to the PSQL server, use `npm run dev` to run the API.

```
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  description VARCHAR (100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TYPE status AS ENUM ('in-progress', 'completed');
ALTER TABLE tasks
ADD COLUMN status status;

CREATE TYPE priority AS ENUM ('low', 'medium', 'high');
ALTER TABLE tasks
ADD COLUMN priority priority;

```

###### If I had more time, I would've also created Sequelize models and a seed script.
